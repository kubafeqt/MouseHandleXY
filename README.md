# 🖱️ Keyboard Mouse Control

Control your mouse entirely using your keyboard — helpful when your touchpad isn't working (e.g., due to driver incompatibility on Windows 10).

## 🔑 Activation

- Press **Left Control twice within 250 milliseconds** to toggle keyboard mouse control.
- Press **Left Shift twice within 250 milliseconds** to enable precise cursor control.

> **Cursor step size**: Normal = 10px, Precise = 2px

## 🎮 Controls

- **Move cursor**: Arrow keys or **W / A / S / D**
- **Left click**: Hold and release **E** (simulates press and release)
- **Right click**: Press **Q**

## 💡 Use Case

This app was created because my laptop's touchpad stopped working on Windows 10 due to a driver incompatibility. It allows full mouse control using only the keyboard.
