# Keyboard Mouse Control

Control your mouse entirely using your keyboard â€” helpful when your touchpad isn't working (e.g. due to driver incompatibility on Windows 10).

## Activation

- Press **Left Control twice within 250 milliseconds** to toggle keyboard mouse control on or off.
- Press **Left Shift twice within 250 milliseconds** to enable or disable precise cursor control.

> **Cursor step size**: Normal = 10px, Precise = 2px

## Controls

- **Move cursor**: Arrow keys or **W / A / S / D**
- **Left click**: Hold and release **E** (simulates press and release)
- **Right click**: Press **Q**

## Use Case

This app was created because my laptop's touchpad not working on Windows 10 due to a driver incompatibility. It allows full mouse control using only the keyboard.

## Planned Features and Innovations

- Middle mouse button simulation  
- Save/load cursor positions with configurable hotkeys
- Configurable hotkeys and delays  
- Custom user-defined sounds
